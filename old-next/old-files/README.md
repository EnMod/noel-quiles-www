# Noel Quiles (.com)

I bring stories to life through code, words, and sound.  On this site you can peruse my recently completed projects as well as some in progress.

You can also browse this repo's branches for the sources of my subdomains, including:
- [My Blog](https://blog.noelquiles.com)
- Various past iterations of the landing page
- Some coursework archives from courses taught by @wesbos:
  - [#JavaScript30](https://js30.noelquiles.com)
  - [What the Flexbox?!](https://wtflex.noelquiles.com)

## How I made this
- Developed with the [Spike](https://spike.cf) build tool and all of its standard tooling. 
- The design was laid out/conceptualized with help from the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) framework.
- Inspiration was liberally taken from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). Always important to keep the basics in mind!
- Site content is managed with [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com) and delivered through their content delivery API. 
- Hosting and final building/compilation/HTTPS/DNS/EVERYTHING ELSE is handled by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
