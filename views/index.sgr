        h2 games

        p I have done quite a bit of game design during and since my college days (ca. 2013).  I've run the design gamut, from level progression and layout, to asset creation, to music, to 3D modeling, to writing, the list goes on.  Programming, however...let's just say that most projects involve countless conditionals and a mess of spaghetti code.

        h3 Hawk-Z

        p(md) You can find my senior games course project [on GitHub](https://github.com/EnMod/Hawk-Z), where I've run the aforementioned gamut. From there you can download the master and try it out on Windows. You'll also be able to find the team's list of credits in the repo's readme.

        h3 Memory Lane

        p(md) I also did a case study of sorts for my TCNJ capstone project, [also on Github](https://github.com/EnMod/Memory-Lane'), regarding the effects of advanced human-computer interaction on an otherwise passive video game experience. Mind, this project uses motion tracking tech that has since become vaporware, more details in the readme. Once I get my hands on an HTC Vive I'll see what I can do to bring it up to speed!

        h3 GBJam 2016 Entry: Neci's Nightmare

        h3 Upcoming Projects

        p Currently I'm working on a narrative-driven ARPG in the style of Diablo and Torchlight, which is in the last stages of pre-production planning. Also in the works is an autobiographical adventure heavily inspired by elements of Makai Toushi SaGa and the Star Ocean series. More on those further in 2017!

        h2 stories
        p If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's how to tell a story. I always enjoy giving life to a world through characters, plot, insane thematic elements, anything I can illustrate through words, or whatever else becomes my medium.

        p(md) All of my prose, poetry, and musings are available on [my blog](https://blog.noelquiles.com)!

        p(md) More of an expression...sorry to disappoint those thinking I'm a producer (for those who have, I'm flattered). I mean hey, if you like what you hear there's more where this came from on [my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/enmod).
