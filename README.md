# Noel Quiles' Portfolio v3

This will be the third version of my site, coming from the `master` branch's overhauled edition of my first foray into non-Dreamweaver webdev a while back. Goals for this new edition are: 

- [ ] Integrating VueJS to more accurately pull off the original vision I had for the site, in a well-performing and maintainable manner (single file Vue components are my long-awaited holy grail)
- [ ] Using a newly-designed logo for my background/other areas, that incorporates my tagline
- [ ] Completely redesigning for mobile first, which in my initial shortsightedness was woefully neglected
- [ ] Follow the tenets of motherfuckingwebsite.com, basically just focusing on being as painfully minimal as possible to get into that habit
- [ ] In that vein, reduce reliance on Velocity or Blast or external libraries for effects, instead using CSS transitions/animations wherever possible (although Blast isn't really reproducible in CSS)
- [ ] Retool the source to use Roots-Mini, as I'm very familiar with Roots and the webpack-only vue-loader is essential to developing with Vue's single-file components
