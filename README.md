# Enlightened Modifications v2
## Thoughts on webdev, gamedev, life, and writing.

This is my new and improved static blog! No more WordPress, no strange systems involving esoteric, non-standard templating. 

It was developed with the [Spike](https://spike.cf) build tool, and all of its standard tooling. The design was laid out/conceptualized with help from the [Bulma](http://bulma.io) framework and inspiration from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). 

Site content is managed
with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) and delivered through their content delivery API. Hosting and final building/compilation/HTTPS/DNS/EVERYTHING ELSE is handled by [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com).

Check out all these tools, they're grand :sparkles:
