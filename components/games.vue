    p I have done quite a bit of game design during and since my college days (ca. 2013).  I've run the design gamut, from level progression and layout, to asset creation, to music, to 3D modeling, to writing...the list goes on.  Programming, however...let's just say that my TCNJ capstone project involved countless conditionals and a mess of spaghetti code.

    p You can find my senior games course project <a href='https://github.com/EnMod/Hawk-Z'>on GitHub</a>, where I've run the aforementioned gamut. There, you can download the master and try it out.  You'll also be able to find my list of credits, as well as that of the team, in the readme.

    p I also did a case study of sorts for my capstone project, <a href='https://github.com/EnMod/Memory-Lane'>also on GitHub</a>. Mind, this one uses motion tracking tech that has since become vaporware, more details in the readme.

    p Currently, I'm working on an autobiographical RPG heavily inspired by Makai Toushi SaGa and Star Ocean, in very early development.  More on that further in 2016!
