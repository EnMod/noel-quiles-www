# Colophon

HTML written in Jade (now Pug), CSS in Stylus, JS in LiveScript, and uses [Roots](http://roots.cx/) for builds.  

Icons designed and created in Inkscape, as well as the header font, which can be found in this repo as `enmod.ttf`.

Uses a simple JS pattern for switching divs in and out using jQuery-selected elements, along with Velocity and Blast for element animations and section transitions.  Uses Lost grid for positioning pretty much everything, with Rupture for mobile adjustments.
