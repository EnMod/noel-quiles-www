        |I have done quite a bit of game design during and since my college days (ca. 2013).  I&#39;ve run the design gamut, from level progression and layout, to asset creation, to music, to 3D modeling, to writing...the list goes on.  Programming, however...let&#39;s just say that my TCNJ capstone project involved countless conditionals and a mess of spaghetti code.

        |You can find my senior games course project
        a(href='https://github.com/EnMod/Hawk-Z') on GitHub
        |, where I&#39;ve run the aforementioned gamut. There, you can download the master and try it out.  You&#39;ll also be able to find my list of credits, as well as that of the team, in the readme.

        |I also did a case study of sorts for my capstone project,
        a(href='https://github.com/EnMod/Memory-Lane') also on GitHub
        |. Mind, this one uses motion tracking tech that has since become vaporware, more details in the readme.  Looking to upgrade this one to current VR tech.

        |Currently, I&#39;m working on an autobiographical RPG heavily inspired by Makai Toushi SaGa and Star Ocean, in very early development.  More on that further in 2016!
