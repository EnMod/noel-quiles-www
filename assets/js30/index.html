      Welcome! For ease of hosting I'm just going to keep these here for now as I complete them.  Click on any of the exercise titles to view the day's work! You can also inspect the code to see my obscene amount of in-place note-taking in the code's comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have any comments or concerns?  Want to respond to something I point out in my walls of comments in the code? Email me at <a href="mailto:contact@noelquiles.com">contact@noelquiles.com</a> or Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/NoelQuiles">@NoelQuiles</a>! I'm more than willing to chat/discuss. 
    </p>

      If you've been looking for the source, you can visit <a href="https://gitlab.com/enmod/javascript30">my repo</a> and take a gander.

    <h2>
      <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/1">Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fun exercise in events and listeners, this definitely helped me brush up on some ES6 I didn't know about in the slightest. Given the emphasis on ES6 adherence in this course I should be re-learning much more as we go.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/2">Day 2: CSS + JS Clock</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Never thought I'd figure out the clock hands/clock face offset issue after changing their heights! There seem to be some signs of improvement already. Made a lot more changes here based on personal taste, had some ideas and decided to run with them.  Nothing earthshattering though.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/3">Day 3: Playing with CSS Variables and JS</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a smorgasbord of new information I learned in this one, being that I've never touched CSS variables. They are MAGICAL. I feel embarrassed to say I haven't been using them at all, but they were pretty easy to pick up.  Shoutouts to <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Wes</a> for making the information easily digestable and the learning experience (dare I say it?) fun!
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/4">Day 4: Array Cardio Day 1</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Get those buns in shape! After building up too much array flab it was inevitable that I had to work it off. I ached in neurons I didn't even know I had!
    </p>
    <p>
      ...my awful workout metaphors aside, this one gave me some ample opportunity for critical thinking in <code>.filter()</code> and <code>.sort()</code>, two methods I had yet to hone.  Also learned out how to MAKE TABLES IN THE CONSOLE FROM OBJECT DATA USING <code>console.table()</code>. BRUH. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/5">Day 5: Flex Panels Image Gallery</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEY. I THOUGHT THIS WAS <strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong>30 NOT <strong>CSS</strong>30. Real talk, there were quite a few clever bits of info in this exercise regarding flexbox.  Something that stuck out the most for me was how WELL CSS and JS work together when separation of concerns is kept at the forefront of one's process. Using pseudo-classes, all I had to do to change how the top/bottom words were animated was toggle a class. Always more to hone!
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/6">Day 6: Ajax Type Ahead</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ajax requests that don't use <code>$.getJSON()</code>?! I kid you not, it can be done, and it isn't nearly as messy as one would think. Old jQuery habits die hard, though...the urge was strong to simplify for the sake of less code in my face.  But hey, that's no way to progress! Vanilla or bust!
