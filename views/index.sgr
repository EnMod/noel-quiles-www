This is my second time using Squarespace for design and layout, as well as updating site contents. Currently, SJHG has responsibility for handling updates and minor design; the current color scheme is their creation.

    #games.container
      h1 games

      p I have done quite a bit of game design during and since my college days (ca. 2013).  I've run the design gamut, from level progression and layout, to asset creation, to music, to 3D modeling, to writing, the list goes on.  Programming, however...let's just say that most projects involve countless conditionals and a mess of spaghetti code.

      p That said, more information below:

      #hawk.box
      #mem.box
      #neci.box
      #soon.box

      h3 Hawk-Z

      p(md) You can find my senior games course project [on GitHub](https://github.com/EnMod/Hawk-Z), where I ran the aforementioned gamut. From there you can download the master and try it out on Windows. You'll also be able to find the team's list of credits in the repo's readme.

      h3 Memory Lane

      p(md) I also did a case study of sorts for my TCNJ capstone project, [also on Github](https://github.com/EnMod/Memory-Lane'), regarding the effects of advanced human-computer interaction on an otherwise passive video game experience. Mind, this project uses motion tracking tech that has since become vaporware, more details in the readme. Once I get my hands on an HTC Vive I'll see what I can do to bring it up to speed!

      h3 GBJam 2016 Entry: Neci's Nightmare

      p(md) In a blaze of inspiration I was compelled to create something for 2016's GBJam, and I knew it had to be related to an upcoming project, *The Origin*. Thus, *Neci's Nightmare* was born!  It's a short "How long can you last?" type of game featuring the protagonist from that project, in which she runs from beasts in her nightmares.  Give it a shot on Windows via its [itch.io page](https://enmod.itch.io/necis-nightmare)!

      h3 Upcoming Projects

      p(md) Currently I'm working on *The Origin*, an ARPG in the style of Diablo and Torchlight, which is in the last stages of pre-production planning. Also in the works is an autobiographical adventure heavily inspired by elements of Makai Toushi SaGa and the Star Ocean series. More on those further in 2017!
    #stories
      h1 stories
      p If there's one thing I pride myself on it's how to tell a story. I always enjoy giving life to a world through visual design, characters, plot, insane thematic elements, anything I can illustrate through whatever becomes my medium.

      p(md) For all of my written word including prose, poetry, musings, and reviews, you can peruse [my blog](https://blog.noelquiles.com)! Here's a selection:

      h1 fresh beats

      p(md) More of an expression...sorry to disappoint those thinking I'm a producer (for those who have, I'm flattered). I mean hey, if you like what you hear there's more where this came from on [my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/enmod).
