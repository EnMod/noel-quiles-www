# Personal/Portfolio Site v3.5

Made with [Spike](https://spike.cf) and all of its standard tooling. Also 
employs some [Flexr](http://flexrgrid.com) gridding. Site content is managed 
with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), and the site itself is 
built/hosted by [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com).

Check out these tools, they're grand :sparkles:
