# Noel Quiles (.com) Changelog
This project's changelog follows the guidelines set by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) with version numbers adherent to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 3.3.0 - 2018-02-26
### Changed
- Body font changed to a rounder font ("Catamaran") as a contrast to my very rigid/square "EnMod" header font.
- Increased the font size to better fit the new font

## 3.2.9 - 2018-02-23
### Changed
- Updated the version number to something that actually follows SemVer and not something I cooked up in my head. I have no other changelogs before this, but I looked at my commit history to arrive at the minor/patch levels.  Being that this is my third redesign of the site I figured a 3.x.x major patch level was appropriate. v4 may not be too far behind! After **three years** building confidence and experience I feel that I can finally pull off my original vision for this site.  Looking forward to it!
