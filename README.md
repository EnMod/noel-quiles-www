I make stories for the monitor and page.  

Be they my stories, or yours, or a brand's, I make sure they're told as well as they can be.  On this site you can peruse my recently completed projects as well as some in progress.

## How I made this
- Developed with the [Spike](https://spike.cf) build tool and all of its standard tooling. 
- The design was laid out/conceptualized with help from the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) framework.
- Inspiration was liberally taken from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). Always important to keep the basics in mind!
- Site content is managed with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) and delivered through their content delivery API. 
- Hosting and final building/compilation/HTTPS/DNS/EVERYTHING ELSE is handled by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
