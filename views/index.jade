					h2 David Silverman Talk Flyer
					h3 Humanist Chaplaincy at Rutgers University
					p Made this flyer to advertise an event for the Humanist Chaplaincy at Rutgers University, in which the (then) president of American Atheists would be giving a talk.  Not my idea to use the meme, but in retrospect its inclusion worked well considering the event featured the man who inspired it.
