# Noel Quiles' #JavaScript30 Archive

Welcome! Go into the `assets/exercises` folder to view a day's work! You can also inspect the code to see my obscene amount of in-place note-taking in the code's comments.

Have any comments or concerns?  Want to respond to something I point out in my walls of comments in the code? Email me at [contact@noelquiles.com](mailto:contact@noelquiles.com) or Tweet me at [@NoelQuiles](https://twitter.com/NoelQuiles)! I'm more than willing to chat/discuss.
