# Modified Musings
## On webdev, gamedev, life, and writing.

This is my static blog, v1.2!

It was developed with the [Spike](https://spike.cf) build tool, and all of its standard tooling. The design was laid out/conceptualized with help from the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) framework and inspiration from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com).

Site content is managed
with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) and delivered through their content delivery API. Hosting and final building/compilation/HTTPS/DNS/EVERYTHING ELSE is handled by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
