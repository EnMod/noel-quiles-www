                h3 South Jersey Heart Group

                p Site created for the South Jersey Heart Group of NJ's Our Lady of Lourdes hospital. This is my second time using Squarespace for design and layout, as well as updating site contents. Currently, SJHG has responsibility for handling updates and minor design; the current color scheme is their creation.

                h2 David Silverman Talk Flyer
                h3 Humanist Chaplaincy at Rutgers University
                p Made this flyer to advertise an event for the Humanist Chaplaincy at Rutgers University, in which the (then) president of American Atheists would be giving a talk.  Not my idea to use the meme, but in retrospect its inclusion worked well considering the event featured the man who inspired it.
