						h2 Squarespace Design/Layout
						h3 South Jersey Heart Group

						p Site created for the South Jersey Heart Group of NJ's Our Lady of Lourdes hospital. This is my second time using Squarespace for design and layout, as well as updating site contents. Currently, SJHG has responsibility for handling updates and minor design; the current color scheme is their creation.

						h2 David Silverman Talk Flyer
						h3 Humanist Chaplaincy at Rutgers University

						p Made this flyer to advertise an event for the Humanist Chaplaincy at Rutgers University, in which the (then) president of American Atheists would be giving a talk.  Not my idea to use the meme, but in retrospect its inclusion worked well considering the event featured the man who inspired it.

		section#games
			h2 games

			p I have done quite a bit of game design during and since my college days (ca. 2013).  I've run the design gamut, from level progression and layout, to asset creation, to music, to 3D modeling, to writing...the list goes on.  Programming, however...let's just say that my TCNJ capstone project involved countless conditionals and a mess of spaghetti code.

			p
				|You can find my senior games course project
				a(href='https://github.com/EnMod/Hawk-Z') on GitHub
				|, where I've run the aforementioned gamut. There, you can download the master and try it out.  You'll also be able to find my list of credits, as well as that of the team, in the readme.

			p
				|I also did a case study of sorts for my capstone project,
				a href='https://github.com/EnMod/Memory-Lane') also on GitHub
				|. Mind, this one uses motion tracking tech that has since become vaporware, more details in the readme. Once I get my hands on an HTC Vive I'll see what I can do to bring it up to speed!

			p Currently, I'm working on an autobiographical RPG heavily inspired by Makai Toushi SaGa and Star Ocean, in very early development.  More on that further in 2016!

		section#stories
			h2 stories
			:markdown
				If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's how to tell a story.  I always enjoy giving life to a world through characters, plot, insane thematic elements, anything I can illustrate through words.

				You'll be able to find my stories on my blog which, like this section itself, is **under construction.**  Once it's completed you can read my stories there.

		section#fresh-beats
			h2 fresh beats

			p
				|Ok, so maybe these beats aren't as fresh as advertised, but there's more where this came from on
				a(href='https://soundcloud.com/enmod') my SoundCloud
