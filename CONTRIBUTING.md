# "How can I help?"

First, make sure you have the latest `node` and `npm` installed!  Currently this site expects `node 14.x.x` and `npm 7.x.x`.

Then just follow these steps:

1. Clone down the repo
2. Run `npm i && npm run dev` in the project root to install dependencies and spin up a local dev server for the site
3. Make your changes and submit a PR to the repo

That's it!
