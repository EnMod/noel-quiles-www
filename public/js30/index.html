      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/1">Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>A fun exercise in events and listeners, this definitely helped me brush up on some ES6 I didn’t know about in the slightest. Given the emphasis on ES6 adherence in this course I should be re-learning much more as we go.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/2">Day 2: CSS + JS Clock</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Never thought I’d figure out the clock hands/clock face offset issue after changing their heights! There seem to be some signs of improvement already. Made a lot more changes here based on personal taste, had some ideas and decided to run with them.  Nothing earthshattering though.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/3">Day 3: Playing with CSS Variables and JS</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>There was a smorgasbord of new information I learned in this one, being that I’ve never touched CSS variables. They are MAGICAL. I feel embarrassed to say I haven’t been using them at all, but they were pretty easy to pick up.  Shoutouts to <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Wes</a> for making the information easily digestable and the learning experience (dare I say it?) fun so far!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/4">Day 4: Array Cardio Day 1</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Get those buns in shape! After building up too much array flab it was inevitable that I had to work it off. I ached in neurons I didn’t even know I had!</p>
      <p>…my awful workout metaphors aside, this one gave me some ample opportunity for critical thinking in <code>.filter()</code> and <code>.sort()</code>, two methods I had yet to hone.  Also learned how to MAKE TABLES IN THE CONSOLE FROM OBJECT DATA USING <code>console.table()</code> BRUH.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/5">Day 5: Flex Panels Image Gallery</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>HEY. I THOUGHT THIS WAS <strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong>30 NOT <strong>CSS</strong>30. Real talk, there were quite a few clever bits of info in this exercise regarding flexbox.  Something that stuck out the most for me was how WELL CSS and JS work together when separation of concerns is kept at the forefront of one’s process. Using pseudo-classes, all I had to do to change how the top/bottom words were animated was toggle a class. Always more to hone!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/6">Day 6: Ajax Type Ahead</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Ajax requests that don’t use <code>$.getJSON()</code>?! I kid you not, it can be done, and it isn’t nearly as messy as one would think. Old jQuery habits die hard, though…the urge was strong to simplify for the sake of less code in my face.  But hey, that’s no way to progress! Vanilla or bust!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/7">Day 7: Array Cardio Day 2</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>It slices! It dices! It’s <code>Array.prototype</code>! Back again are a slew of methods for making any kind of data behave. I always liked the simplicity of <code>.slice()</code> but it shone even more when using the alternative <code>desiredResult = [...everythingAround,...whatYouDontWant]</code> way of taking out an array item I don’t want. Going to have to do more React projects to see why that latter way is so popular, because at present it seems a bit too verbose.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/8">Day 8: HTML5 Canvas</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>If anyone reading this has used <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, this day’s work might look familiar. Yes, like Processing’s first exercises we’ve been given the task of creating a drawing canvas! This time, however, we’ve got the full power of ES6…oh man it’s like night and day.  Then again, I’ve learned a hell of a lot in six years.</p>
      <p>It got me thinking, there was a game I made in Processing back then that could probably be replicated with web tech…might talk more about that on <a href="https://noelquiles.com/blog">my blog</a> when the time comes!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/9">Day 9: 14 Must Know Dev Tools Tricks</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Veteran developers hate him!  Read on as developer Wes Bos reveals his most heavily guarded techniques!</p>
      <p>Did the day’s title read like that of a listicle to anyone else? Anyway, those devtools tricks are very cool.  The console is one of the most versatile aspects of the browser, with so much useful debugging that can be done with it.  I shudder to think of the sheer amount of other tools the browser has waiting to be used…I know I’ve never touched most of it.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/10">Day 10: Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>It’s just shift-selecting, can’t be that hard yeah?  Just a simple few lines and that’s it heh heh – WRONG.</p>
      <p>While it’s not a complete solution for shift-selecting, the behavior outlined in this exercise is paramount to developing selection interactions in apps like Gmail, todo lists, etc. To my surprise I was about a line of code ahead of Wes as I proceeded through the exercise!  That said, I had no clue what to do at first, beyond usual setup of <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> calls.  What’s the amount of hours it takes for mastery?  10,000?  Seems I still have a long way to go!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/11">Day 11: Custom HTML5 Video Player</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>This was a MARATHON.  My respect for anyone with a custom styled video player has gone through the roof; this one took work and several functions, though the final result wasn’t actually that monolithic.  Wes’s elegance took my inital attempts and said “GO HOME, YOU’RE NOT TOUGH ENOUGH FOR <em>THIS</em> SITE.”, after which they promptly fled with their inefficiency and convolution dangling behind them.  The more I have that happen, the more I learn, so LET’S KEEP IT UP.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/12">Day 12: Key Sequence Detection</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>EVERYONE seems to know about the Konami code, whether they play games extensively or not. Wes was going for a simpler method to teach the concept, but I wasn’t satisfied with just any old string…I had to go for the code itself!</p>
      <p>In order to do that I used an array of keys (similar to what we end up looking for in the exercise) instead of a string which, essentially, is a joined array of characters. Realizing this, I thought to use the retrieved keys from <code>e.key</code> instead of characters, then compared the joined, clipped <code>keysPressed</code> array with the joined <code>code</code>, since comparing the arrays directly didn’t work (?).  Finally, the user was rewarded with silliness and 30 extra lives, just like the Konami code’s progenitor!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/13">Day 13: Slide In on Scroll</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Pretty simple stuff here…on the surface. As always, hitting a moving target can be annoying, but with the power of math anything is possible~! <em>cue fanfare</em></p>
      <p>This exercise was a lot more of a math test than a set of new concepts, focusing on how to hit a target scroll distance without hardcoding it or making it too rigid. One declaration, one event bind, one function (minus the provided debounce)…not much to say other than I picked up a technique I would have just looked up a library for back in the day.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/14">Day 14: Object and Arrays - Reference VS Copy</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>I think Yipes explained today’s exercise best: <a href="https://youtu.be/YYiRlbtN3Iw?t=1m18s">"There’s not much to explain here, he’s just getting hit."</a>, where:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">const Dante = 'Wes'
const bullets = 'knowledge'
const Magneto = 'me'
</code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/15">Day 15: LocalStorage and Event Delegation</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Quite the monster today…tackling a newish concept for me in the form of <code>localStorage</code>.  Turns out, it wasn’t really that much to tackle!  I’d already done some form of event delegation in the past on other projects/work, but never used localStorage…oh no what if it’s this crazy new thing I won’t wrap my head around for months?!</p>
      <p>…It’s a glorified object that only takes strings as values.  At least that’s how I quickly understood it. Going to have to review this one again for the details.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/16">Day 16: CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>WOAH! is right! Very trippy effect that was achieved surprisingly simply. A big takeaway was even MORE ES6 shorthand in the form of a syntax akin to objects of variables.  It seemed WAY harder to read than straight declarations, but it probably makes for good micro-optimization.  The important thing is I’ve got some more handy tips under my belt.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/17">Day 17: Sorting Band Names Without Articles</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Something that becomes clearer with each of these exercises is: it’s always easier than you think. At first I thought ignoring the articles was going to take all sorts of work…however, it’s just using an article-stripping function at the exact moment you need to! Very cool to see in action.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/18">Day 18: Tally String Times with Reduce</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Back from a hiatus of about four months, this was the result of finally diving into Wes’s lessons again! It’s like I never left~</p>
      <p>This time it was a useful tool to have: tallying up video times such that your total is a properly formatted sum of times in seconds, displayed in hours, seconds, and minutes. Crazy that you can do it all in one <code>reduce()</code> as well…then again it’s always easier to find corners to cut after you’re done (or have an instructor like Wes to tell you).</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/19">Day 19: Webcam Fun</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>I have never, EVER worked with a media device in any sort of programming before this, but the methodology was similar to previous “grab data, do things to the data, put it back” work that I’ve done before. The only real tripper-upper here was the ways in which that data is represented in the browser; it took a bit of rumination to really grok the inner workings of how data would flow from device to canvas.</p>
      <p>After being spoiled by Godot Engine’s easily grasped API and VERY HELPFUL helper functions, manipulating captured data almost seemed…tedious in JavaScript! That’s the major difference between webdev and gamedev scripting it seems; control and security over sheer speed and efficiency. But I digress; learning how to do in-browser chroma-keying was the highlight of this one.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/20">Day 20: Speech Recognition</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>This one would have been really fun to work with…if my setup of Windows Subsystem for Linux running Spike to compile the exercises was considered "secure." Because it isn’t I had to just take notes and sit this one out ;_; The link above should work considering the origin is secure, but no silly speech results for me during the process :C</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/21">Day 21: Geolocation Data Tracking</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Similar to Day 20, my setup was not conducive to running the exercise (in 20’s case I could have used the bundled <code>browser-sync</code>, but call me stubborn), but I did take those notes.  Going to check the link on my phone in the near future to see how it ends up working, you can do the same and it should work out!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/22">Day 22: Follow Along Link Highlighter</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Felt good to be a step ahead during some bits of this one! Again I’m noticing some overlap between programming for the web and programming for 2D games, specifically in Godot Engine using its pixel-bound measurements.</p>
      <p>Top/left values are used as the basis for most coordinates in element props (<code>window.scrollX</code>, <code>window.height</code> starting from the left, etc.) and used as the basis for <em>everything</em> in Godot’s 2D engine. This brings a familiarity with how elements are laid out in the DOM/game, as well as how they’re referred to and have their props adjusted by the code.</p>
      <p>P.S.: In fact, there’s a lot to say about the similarities I’m noticing between Godot’s SceneTree and scripting, and the DOM and JS. I’ll cover that in a <a href="https://noelquiles.com/blog/categories/webdev">blog post</a> after I get done my recent games’ post-mortems (they’re coming believe me!!!).</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/23">Day 23: The Voiceinator 5000</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>I had an unquellable urge to do something extra with this exercise, so I decided to integrate a checkbox below the voices dropdown.  It does its job, but for some reason, box checked or no (made test results very ambiguous), it only works on every other call of <code>toggle()</code>.  I reviewed the code multiple times to no avail…maybe it’s my wonderful Windows setup only providing two voices that was the issue? <a href="https://twitter.com/NoelQuiles">Tweet me</a> if you know the solution to my issues and want to let me know lol.</p>
      <p>Either way, the results are satisfactory enough for me. Made sure to take notes on <code>bind()</code> and arrow functions’ uses for calling a function with arguments in an event listener, without having to call a big ol’ anon function.  Good stuff all around!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/24">Day 24: Sticky Nav</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>I swear, every time I complete a JS30 I look back at my early years of webdev and weep. To think if I just sat down for a second and thought about what I should do in the browser, I wouldn’t have had to search for library after library after library. Well, as Crush 40 says: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9zZus_1_ag">Live and Learn!</a></p>
      <p>What exactly was learnt? A vanilla method to adjust sizes of items in the navigation as well as fix it to the top while scrolling.  Sounds pretty simple, but it could be applied to pretty much anything you’d like to reveal or fix on a certain scroll point, of course with some adjustment.  A very useful, very widely applicable bit of code.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/25">Day 25: Event Propagation</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>An interesting demonstration of JavaScript’s native behaviors.  I noticed bubbling is verrrry similar to the way a lightening strike works (more or less…I’m no meteorologist):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Electricity traces a path through the air from source to destination.</li>
        <li>It reaches the destination, followed by a surge launched in the opposite direction.</li>
        <li>The surge goes back up the path toward the source.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In JS event propagation, the browser captures events as it seeks its destination node (where the event occurred), starting from the top of the DOM.  Then, starting from the destination node, the browser retraces its steps and fires the event listener’s callback wherever there was an event captured on the way down.  It keeps going till it reaches the top of the DOM.</p>
      <p>This is really good to know and keep handy for future use.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/26">Day 26: Stripe Follow Along Nav</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>It’s always so intriguing to me how the simplest of solutions is usually the best.  In order to pull off something similar to the Stripe dropdown’s “following div”, the basic work had already been done in the follow-along link highlighter we already made.  To apply the principle to the dropdown background, all it took were some classes to handle its visibility, and toggling those classes on mouseenter and mouseleave.</p>
      <p>The <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> work was very similar to that of the link highlighter, so I was familiar with it. A good bit of practice here (that I was completely clueless about going in since I didn’t really give it much thought at first).</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/27">Day 27: Click and Drag</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Might come back to this one since I’m not understanding positioning well enough.  I completed the exercise as demonstrated, but was attempting to implement a way to move the div in the Y direction.  That…didn’t seem to work out.  What’s left of my attempt is in the code if anyone would like to take a gander.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/28">Day 28: Video Speed Controller</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Interesting…when I tried to define the percentage decimal directly in the speed percentage calculation it wouldn’t properly multiply it by 100, but when I seperated the percentage decimal out to its own variable it did. I must not know math as well as I thought I did!</p>
      <p>Another fun note.  The video link was broken so I checked the source repo to see if there was another one added since I last downloaded the source. I then check the commit date, not expecting it to be that long since I first downloaded the source and started this project:</p>
      <p>
        <code>snopeks committed on Aug 9, 2017</code>
      </p>
      <p>…Yikes.  Let’s wrap this thing up.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noelquiles.com/js30/29">Day 29: Countdown Timer</a>
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>I took a peek at the finished <code>scripts.js</code> for the loc count while setting up the exercise…50+ lines for a countdown clock?! That was just the <em>minimum</em> for what we were to achieve in the exercise, of course additional features would be more. Goes to show you how much of a process it is to code things into being!</p>
      <p>Went a little further with it and experimented with modulo-ing weeks, months, days, etc.  Also changed the “Enter minutes” input to be of <code>type="number"</code> so I could set <code>max="120"</code> on it.  No slacking off!</p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>Finally.  After <em>months</em> of hiatuses, other priorities, and adjustments to my own schedule, I have completed the last of JS30: Whack-a-Mole.</p>
      <p>Really? <em>This</em> is the final challenge?! I kid, it was a blast to code a game for the web for the first time, and it took so much less time than I thought!  Of course, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">@wesbos</a> and his having the code thought-out and ready 🔥  I was also able to really glide through this one thanks to time spent coding two games in Godot Engine, and the similarities between its workflow and that of frontend coding.</p>
      <p>Again, shoutouts to <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">@wesbos</a> for JavaScript30 and all the great tips/knowledge I picked up along the way! Go check out <a href="https://wesbos.io">his site</a> for even more courses on even more in-depth topics, such as flexbox, React, and Node.js!</p>
