# Noel Quiles' Site v3

Made with [Spike](https://spike.cf) and all of its standard tooling. Also employs some [Flexr](http://flexrgrid.com) gridding. Here are the relevant parsers used by Spike's standard tooling, for the curious:
- [SugarML](https://github.com/posthtml/sugarml)
- [SugarSS](https://github.com/postcss/sugarss)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

Seriously check out Spike, it's grand :sparkles:
